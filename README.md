# Anti-Phishing Strategy: Python-Based Tool #

## Overview ##
The Anti-Phishing Strategy is a Python script designed to target and disrupt phishing websites. It works by flooding these sites with fake email and password combinations, potentially crashing their servers or making it impossible to distinguish real data from fake. This tool should be used responsibly and only against sites with malicious intent.

## How to Deploy the Anti-Phishing Strategy ##

### Step 1: Downloading the Tool ###
Download the toolkit:

### Step 2: Launching the Application ###
Open the Anti-Phishing Strategy program. Make sure to run it in the default directory it came with, but do not input any data yet.

### Step 3: Identifying a Phishing Site ###
Locate a potential phishing website. Often, these can be found in suspicious emails that seem legitimate.

### Step 4: Visiting the Site ###
Go to the phishing website. They often look legitimate but can be identified by inspecting their URL.

### Step 5: Using Browser Developer Tools ###
On the phishing site, open Google Chrome's developer tools by pressing F12.

### Step 6: Network Monitoring ###
Switch to the 'Network' tab and activate the 'Preserve log' option.

### Step 7: Entering Fake Credentials ###
Enter a false email and password on the phishing site. **Do not use real information.**

### Step 8: Observing Network Activity ###
Post-login, look for suspicious files or activities in the network log.

### Step 9: Analyzing Headers ###
Select any suspicious files to view their headers.

### Step 10: Extracting Request URL ###
In the header, locate and copy the 'Request URL'.

### Step 11: Tool Configuration ###
Paste the copied URL into the Anti-Phishing Strategy's command line interface.

### Step 12: Capturing Form Data ###
In the header's 'Form Data' section, copy the text before the colon. This varies based on the site's coding.

### Step 13: Inputting Data ###
Input the copied string into the tool's command line, and repeat for the password field.

### Step 14: Activation ###
Hit enter. If the command line populates data as shown in the example, the tool is now active and operational.

## Note ##
This tool is powerful and effective but should be used with caution and within legal and ethical boundaries. Its purpose is to safeguard the digital community against phishing threats.
